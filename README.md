A secure, containerized installation script for Cisco Packet Tracer on Linux using Distrobox.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

When I switched from Windows to Fedora, I needed Cisco Packet Tracer for my CCNA studies. Problem: Cisco only provides a .deb installer (for Debian/Ubuntu), which doesn't work on Fedora's RPM-based system.

I could've tried converting it with alien or other tools, but that's unreliable. I could've dual-booted Ubuntu or run a full VM, but that's overkill. So I built this script instead.

**The solution:** Run Packet Tracer in an isolated Ubuntu 22.04 container using Distrobox. The .deb installer works perfectly, and you get these benefits:
- Works on any Linux distro (Fedora, Arch, openSUSE, etc.)
- No system clutter from extensive dependencies
- Security through isolation of proprietary software
- Clean uninstall - just delete the container
- Native desktop integration - launches like a local app

Now I use this approach for any .deb-only application on Fedora.

## ✨ Features

- 🛡️ **Containerized isolation** - Packet Tracer runs in its own environment
- 🔐 **Restricted X11 access** - Only your user can access the display
- 🧹 **Automatic cleanup** - X11 permissions close when app exits
- 📦 **No host pollution** - All dependencies stay in the container
- 🚀 **Easy launch** - Desktop menu integration included
- ✅ **Error handling** - Validates files and handles edge cases

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Linux distribution** with X11 or Wayland
- **Distrobox** installed ([installation guide](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox))
- **Podman** or **Docker** (Podman recommended)
- **Packet Tracer .deb file** from [Cisco NetAcad](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)

### Install Distrobox

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install distrobox podman
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download the Script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/packet-tracer-secure-setup.git
cd packet-tracer-secure-setup
chmod +x setup.sh
```

### 2. Get Packet Tracer

1. Go to [Cisco NetAcad](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
2. Sign in (or create a free account)
3. Download the **Linux 64-bit .deb** file
4. Note the download location (usually `~/Downloads/`)

### 3. Run the Installer

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
1. Create an isolated container named `PTBox`
2. Install all necessary dependencies
3. Set up a secure launcher script
4. Create a desktop menu entry
5. Prompt you for the .deb file location
6. Install and extract Packet Tracer

### 4. Launch Packet Tracer

**Option A:** From your application menu
- Look for "Cisco Packet Tracer (Secure)"

**Option B:** From terminal
```bash
~/launch_pt.sh
```

## 🔧 What Gets Installed

### On Your Host System
- `~/.pt_container_home/` - Container home directory
- `~/launch_pt.sh` - Launcher script
- `~/.local/share/applications/packettracer.desktop` - Menu entry

### Inside the Container
- Ubuntu 22.04 base
- Required graphics and X11 libraries
- Packet Tracer application files in `~/.pt_app/`

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Container Isolation
- Separate home directory prevents access to your real home
- Container has limited system access
- Network namespace isolation (depending on Distrobox config)

### X11 Access Control
```bash
xhost +SI:localuser:$USER  # Only your user can access display
```
This is more restrictive than the default `xhost +local:docker` which would allow any container.

### Automatic Cleanup
The launcher automatically revokes X11 access when Packet Tracer closes, minimizing exposure time.

### Input Validation
- Verifies .deb file exists
- Checks file extension
- Validates it's actually a Debian package
- Handles errors gracefully

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "distrobox: command not found"
Install Distrobox first:
```bash
sudo apt install distrobox podman
```

### "Cannot connect to display"
Make sure X11 is running. On Wayland, ensure XWayland is installed:
```bash
sudo apt install xwayland
```

### "Permission denied" when accessing .deb file
Make sure the file path is correct and readable:
```bash
ls -l ~/Downloads/CiscoPacketTracer*.deb
```

### Container already exists
The script will detect this and ask if you want to recreate it.

### Graphics Issues
Some systems may need additional configuration. Try:
```bash
distrobox-enter -n PTBox -- glxinfo | grep "OpenGL"
```

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

Remove everything cleanly:

```bash
# Remove the container
distrobox rm -f PTBox

# Remove installed files
rm -rf ~/.pt_container_home
rm ~/launch_pt.sh
rm ~/.local/share/applications/packettracer.desktop

# Update desktop database
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Container Creation**: Creates an Ubuntu 22.04 container with isolated home
2. **Dependency Installation**: Installs X11, graphics, and Qt libraries
3. **Launcher Script**: Creates a wrapper that manages X11 permissions
4. **Desktop Integration**: Adds menu entry for easy access
5. **AppImage Extraction**: Extracts Packet Tracer from the .deb installer

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is an unofficial installation method. Cisco Packet Tracer is proprietary software owned by Cisco Systems. You must have a valid NetAcad account and agree to Cisco's terms of service.

This script does not modify or crack Packet Tracer in any way - it simply provides a secure containerized environment for the official software.
